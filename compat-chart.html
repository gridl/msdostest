DOSBox MS-DOS application compat testing chart<br>
MS-DOS testing repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/msdostest">https://github.com/joncampbell123/msdostest</a><br>
<br>
DOSBox-X refers to the <a target="_blank" href="http://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X project</a><br>
DOSBox-SVN refers to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox project</a><br>
<br>
Rules regarding PASS or FAIL:<br>
- If a game crashes, faults, or shows behavior that suggests a problem, that is a FAIL.<br>
- Known faulty behavior in the game itself doesn't count as failure. Future development may offer off-by-default hacks or workarounds in the emulator for the problem.<br>
- Known faulty behavior that occurs on real hardware doesn't count as failure, because it means DOSBox is emulating real hardware accurately and the game is at fault.<br>
- Issues that are DOSBox-SVN's fault, that the DOSBox SVN developers have expressed an unwillingness to fix or accept patches to fix, do not count as failure.<br>
<br>
Common problems with DOSBox SVN so far:<br>
- Lack of support for &quot;goldplay&quot; Sound Blaster playback. Audio is rendered &quot;muffled&quot; in DOSBox SVN.<br>
- LPT DAC output doesn't work. However code explicitly written for the Disney Sound Source works.<br>
- PC speaker emulation on/off and frequency changes are limited to 1ms precision. This affects some games as well as old Apogee titles like Duke Nukum.<br>
- Some games rely on INT 16h AH=1 undefined behavior regarding ZF flag (standard only describes CF flag), which so far has been confirmed on at least one 386 system and may occur in other old systems.<br>
<br>
Common problems to both DOSBox-X and DOSBox-SVN:<br>
- Having UMB or EMS enabled can cause crashiness in some games.<br>
- Some games require XMS to be enabled, will call to a NULL pointer otherwise.<br>
- Some games will crash or malfunction if loaded too low (below 64KB) in memory. Try loadfix or the minimum mcb segment option.<br>
<br>
Problems that do NOT count as failures against DOSBox SVN, because they are bugs in the game itself:<br>
- Audio halting or interrupt problems with GUS or SB related to a failure to unmask the IRQ (gamecoder laziness, NOT SVN's fault).<br>
- Hangs related to undefined or reserved bits in VGA emulation that the game really ought to ignore.<br>
